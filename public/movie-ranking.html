<h1>The best movies according to gaba</h1>
<h2>My 3 all-time favorite movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lalaland</h3>
<p>I was amazed by the soundtrack in this movie, 
    despite of me not liking musical movies, 
    this one was was the first musical that i really 
    like, also the romantic history between the main 
    characters, its so deep , the ending plot twist, 
    i wasnt expecting that for sure. </p>
<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>This movie is like a time-machine to the past, 
    it remember me my young days, the comedy in this 
    movie its simply Unbeatable, at least the latin
     ersion, because Eugenio Derbex did a great job 
    playing as "burro, so in fact this is a perfect 
    movie, drama, comedy, god history, and a glorius
    animation style</p>
<h3>The art of racing in the rain</h3>
<p>This one is very simple, i love dogs, 
    so if you conbine the dogs with a sad histroy,
    my heart its going to remember that movie foreve,
    depite of my dog fanaticism, 
    its  a relly good movie, great histoy,
    animation, sacript,  with a good ending.</p>
